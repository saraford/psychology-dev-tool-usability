<p>In 2015, I received my Masters degree in Human Factors (read: User Experience in HCI) because I wanted to learn how to make developer tools usable. I've been building developer tools for over 15 years. After graduating with degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics, I joined Microsoft's Visual Studio team. I first got interested in developer tool usability after leading the accessibility and UX consistency testing efforts for Visual Studio 2005. But it was when I was the PM for CodePlex, Microsoft's open source project hosting site, where I learned the power of user-centered design and proper research methods from working with a UX consulting firm. I decided I had to learn how this UX consulting firm did their job, so I went back to grad school to learn all about psychology, research methods, kinesiology and motor learning, and of course proper office desk ergonomics. :)</p>

<p>I'm going to err on over-attributing, so stop reading this site right now and go get the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Mind-Second-Understanding-Guidelines/dp/0124079148">Designing with the Mind in Mind</a>. It's the best crash course on everything I learned in grad school, without any of the pain. </p>
